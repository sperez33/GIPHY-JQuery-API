# GIPHY-JQuery-API
Making a simple API call to Giphy to access free gifs using JQuery

July.11.2019 - 12:30pm - Added in the search bar and button on the HTML sheet, they don't do anything yet but they're visually there. I added an alert in the JS to make sure I could access the JS.

July.11.2019 - 12:48pm - added an 'onclick' function to the button on the HTML side and began coding the function in giphy-api.js. In the JS file in addition to creating the master function 'getData', I also added two variable that communicate with Giphy asking for a specific set of of gifs and creating a variable to pull that information from the text box.

July.11.2019 - 1:01pm - I added a few lines on the HTML page connected to an online JQuery source and 3 downloaded open source ones that give proper functionality to the JQuery I wrote for the API.
